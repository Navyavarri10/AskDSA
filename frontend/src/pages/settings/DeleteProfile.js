          Before confirming that you would like your profile deleted, we'd like
          to take a moment to explain the implications of deletion:

        <ul className="mt-3">
          <li>
            Deletion is irreversible, and you will have no way to regain any of
            your original content, should this deletion be carried out and you
            change your mind later on.
          </li>
          <li className="mt-2">
            Your questions and comments will remain on the site, but will be
            disassociated and anonymized (the author will be listed as "user
            {userId}
            ") and will not indicate your authorship even if you later return to
            the site.
